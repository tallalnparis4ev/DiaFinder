Hello everyone 👋 first of all, thank you so much for even checking out this project 🎉

## What problem are we solving?

I hope to God (for whatever definition of God you believe in 😛) that you have never had a disease that requires medication. Diseases like diabetes sometimes require a person to medicate themselves with insulin with each meal otherwise they could potentially die 💀!

As you can imagine, or can’t 😛, diabetics can become very anxious when travelling or moving to a new place! Why? Because the current system makes it SO hard to very seamlessly find out where and how diabetes medications are available in certain countries!

## How are we solving it?

We provide a website that is self funded and hosted at [NOT HOSTED YET]. This website allows a person to search for a diabetes medication and quickly find out how to obtain it for a particular location.

## How can you contribute?

The website is actually really simple in terms of functionality. **The thing that is hard is to find the data on how to get a particular medication in a particular location!** So the main impact you can have is to add as many methods to find particular medications!

Check out the following https://github.com/tallalnparis4ev/DiaFinder/commit/de46443829a32309d7f2a5b784cd4fc810c3fb89 which exemplifies on how you can do this!

## How to run the project locally?

- npm install  --legacy-peer-deps
- npm run dev
- access the website on localhost:3000

The search function won’t work unfortunately, it needs a Google API key.

Friends 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, let’s harness our good energy 🌈 to make a difference in this world 🌎.
